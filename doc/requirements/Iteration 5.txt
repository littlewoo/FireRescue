Iteration 5:

Movement

Deadline: 11 May 2014

Features:

-Firefighters get 4AP per turn
-Each square moved costs 1AP
-Walls can be placed between squares (static class provides board, including walls), and block movement
-When it is a firefighter's turn to move, movement is shown by circles marking squares. Clicking on a circle moves the firefighter there, and deducts the correct number of AP.
